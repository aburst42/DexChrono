# DexFit

DexFit provides an example for how to show blood glucose levels on a Fitbit (Ionic or Versa) watch face. You can use the instructions [here](https://github.com/aburst42/DexFit/wiki/DexFit-Setup-Instructions) to set up the watch face for your own watch.

See the [wiki] (https://github.com/aburst42/DexFit/wiki) for more information.
